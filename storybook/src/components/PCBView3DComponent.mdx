The `PCBView3D` provides an interactive 3D representation of the circuit board. It allows users to rotate, pan, and zoom to inspect physical aspects of the design such as layer stacking and component height.

## Features
- **Interactive Controls**: Supports mouse-based rotation (drag) and zooming (scroll).
- **Physical Representation**: Renders board thickness and dimensions based on props.
- **View Reset**: Quick action to return to the default isometric view.

## Usage

```html
<PCBView3D
  :board-width="100"
  :board-height="80"
  :board-thickness="1.6"
/>
```
