The `ThemeVerification` component is a visual testing utility designed to validate component behavior under different theming contexts (Dark vs Light). It renders a side-by-side comparison of core UI elements to ensure consistency.

## Purpose
- **Visual Regression**: Quickly identify broken styles in different themes.
- **Component Audit**: Verify that buttons, inputs, and typography adhere to token definitions.
- **Layout Check**: Ensure spacing and containers behave correctly in both modes.
